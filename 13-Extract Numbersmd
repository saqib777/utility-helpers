## Utility 13: Extract Numbers

### What It Does

This helper extracts all numeric digits or full numbers from a given text. It can return numbers as a string, a list of separated numbers, or even convert them into integers. This is useful when processing logs, forms, IDs, quantities, or any text where numbers matter.

Example:

* Input: "Order 245 shipped on 2025-11-13"
* Output: ["245", "2025", "11", "13"]

### Explanation

Numbers appear in text frequently. Sometimes you want to pull them out while ignoring the rest. Python makes this simple using regular expressions, list comprehensions, or manual loops.

We’ll cover:

1. Extracting individual digits
2. Extracting full numbers
3. Extracting and converting numbers into integers

### Code Examples

#### Method 1: Extract All Digits

```python
import re

def extract_digits(text):
    """
    Extract individual digits from the text.
    Returns a list of digits as strings.
    """
    return re.findall(r"\d", text)

# Example
print(extract_digits("Room 101 on floor 2"))  # Output: ['1', '0', '1', '2']
```

This is helpful if you only need single digits.

---

#### Method 2: Extract Full Numbers

```python
import re

def extract_numbers(text):
    """
    Extract full numbers from text.
    Returns a list of numeric strings.
    """
    return re.findall(r"\d+", text)

# Example
print(extract_numbers("Order 245 shipped on 2025-11-13"))
# Output: ['245', '2025', '11', '13']
```

This approach captures multi-digit values as complete numbers.

#### Method 3: Extract Numbers as Integers

```python
import re

def extract_numbers_as_int(text):
    """
    Extract numbers and convert them into integers.
    """
    return [int(num) for num in re.findall(r"\d+", text)]

# Example
print(extract_numbers_as_int("ID 4001: value increased by 37"))
# Output: [4001, 37]
```

Useful when numbers will be used in calculations.

---

#### Method 4: Extract Decimal or Floating Numbers

```python
import re

def extract_floats(text):
    """
    Extract floating point numbers, including decimals.
    """
    return re.findall(r"\d+\.\d+", text)

# Example
print(extract_floats("The ratio is 3.14 and the score is 99.5"))
# Output: ['3.14', '99.5']
```

This helps when handling measurements or precise values.

---

### Real-Life Use Case

Extracting numbers is common when cleaning data from logs, forms, or web scraping. For example, extracting all numerical IDs from a line of text:

```python
def extract_ids(text):
    return extract_numbers_as_int(text)

print(extract_ids("Users: 104, 209, 330 active today"))
# Output: [104, 209, 330]
```

This allows you to separate meaningful numeric data from mixed text.

### Summary

| Method           | Technique           | Pros                  | Best For                |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Digit extraction | Regex `\d`          | Gets single digits    | Simple logs or codes    |
| Full numbers     | Regex `\d+`         | Gets complete numbers | General text processing |
| Integer list     | Convert via `int()` | Ready for math use    | Calculations            |
| Extract floats   | Regex for decimals  | Gets precise values   | Measurements, stats     |

### Next Step

Next, we can create Utility 14: extract_words(text) to isolate and return only alphabetic words from any given string.
